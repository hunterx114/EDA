# üìä HR Analytics - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis on an HR dataset to identify trends, outliers, and key factors influencing employee attrition.

---

## üîç Objective

Understand the HR data using:
- Descriptive statistics
- Visual analysis (histograms, boxplots, pairplots)
- Correlation matrix
- Outlier and pattern detection

Dataset: `HR_comma_sep.csv`

## üìà Steps Performed

### 1. Data Loading and Summary
- Checked nulls, data types, shape
- Used `.describe()` to get basic statistics

### 2. Univariate Analysis
- Plotted histograms for numeric columns
- Plotted count plots for categorical columns

### 3. Bivariate Analysis
- Boxplots of numeric columns vs `left`
- Pairplot with `hue='left'`
- Correlation heatmap using Seaborn

### 4. Outlier Detection
- Loop-based boxplots show outliers and median shift
- Insights on overwork, high projects, etc.

### 5. Categorical Encoding
- Converted `salary` and `department` to numeric for ML-readiness

## üß† Key Insights

- Employees with **low satisfaction** or **extremely high/low project count** tend to leave.
- Long working hours are also related to attrition.
- Employees with **low salary** leave more often.
- Some outliers in `average_montly_hours` and `time_spend_company`.

## üíª Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
